            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Natalie and Mare-France met in 2010 when they both worked at the university in Ã–stersund. Both were expats, both had Canadian roots, and both had husbands who were either not at home during the week or away for months for military service abroad. And so began the weekly dinners. Every week, they would meed for a simple dinner: to chat, eat delicious food and be in good company. It soon became obvious that, regardless of who was the hostess, the main course was becoming increasingly secondary and turning into something they had to get through before they could get to the pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance: <em>dessert</em>. Every week, the excitement around what the other had prepared for dessert grew and, probably because both have a sweet tooth, dessert became what dinner wase built around.</p>
